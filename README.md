Abstract:
---------
Visual perception is the combination of physical and thoughtful design of human beings that provides the ability to interpret the
environment and the information in a way that it creates meaning. Nonetheless, visual perception is prone to be misled in environments
that are introduced to various distortions. One such example is the cognitive bias. Cognitive bias is as a systematic error that
introduces drifts and distortions in the human judgment towards the direction in which tendency to the typical case is dominant. 
Cognitive bias plays a significant role in evaluating the data visualizations in the decision-making process. There are existing
studies which shows that introducing priming and anchoring biases in scatter plots affects the task of class separation. However,
the effects of cognitive bias in a visual analytical system is yet to be explored.
